# Changelog

## 1.0.17 - 2026-04-22

### Added

- persistent on-disk session storage so production containers no longer rely on Express's in-memory `MemoryStore`
- incremental metadata cache maintenance and regression tests for single-book upserts, removals, and warm-cache reuse

### Changed

- stopped blocking server startup on a full library metadata rebuild and moved startup reconciliation into the background
- rebuilt the EPUB metadata cache flow so unchanged books keep their existing cached cover previews and metadata instead of being re-extracted on every boot, refresh, upload, or delete
- stabilized cover cache versioning per book so a normal metadata reconcile no longer invalidates every cover URL across the whole library
- enabled gzip compression on app responses and added metadata-ready headers to the library catalog endpoint for warmer startup behavior
- reworked the library browser for large shelves with memoized derived book lists, debounced search, lighter shelf collection state, and progressive infinite rendering in grid and compact views instead of mounting every card at once

## 1.0.16 - 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- stopped startup metadata refresh from embedding full-size cover images into `db/epubData.json`, which could exhaust the Node heap on larger libraries and leave the container stuck restarting
- limited fallback cover detection to a small set of likely candidates and generated compact preview covers instead, keeping boot-time library scans lightweight even for image-heavy EPUB collections

## 1.0.15 - 2026-04-22

### Changed

- upgraded the shared `dyslibria-converter` dependency to `0.3.0`
- enabled the converter's default EPUB image optimization profile for all uploaded books so self-hosted processing now uses the same aggressive-safe size reduction path by default

## 1.0.7 - 2026-04-21

### Added

- an in-modal upload progress bar for library batch uploads, including live byte progress, queue confirmation, and clear failure messaging during large multi-book uploads
- a new reader page margin slider so readers can move the text block further in from the edge of the screen and tune the page feel more like a dedicated ereader

### Changed

- kept the upload modal open and informative while files are still transferring or being validated by the server
- tuned the reader padding logic so the new page margin setting stays comfortable across phone and larger-screen layouts

## 1.0.6 - 2026-04-21

### Added

- integrated the published `dyslibria-converter@0.2.0` npm package into the self-hosted app so Docker, the hosted worker path, and local tooling now share the same EPUB conversion engine
- package-backed EPUB inspection during upload so invalid or malformed books are rejected earlier
- structured conversion step logging from the shared package into Dyslibria's existing in-app conversion logs
- loading skeletons and cached shelf rendering for faster-feeling library open and return-to-library flows
- incremental card rendering and cached cover delivery for smoother large-library performance on slower hardware
- fullscreen PWA display mode so installed Dyslibria feels more native on supported devices

### Changed

- pinned the conversion engine dependency to an exact package version for reproducible Docker and local installs
- kept failed conversions quarantined while cleaning up partial processed outputs more reliably
- updated the install and release docs to reflect the published package-backed pipeline and current image tag example

### Notes

- no storage path migration is required for this release
- Docker persistence paths remain `/usr/src/app/uploads`, `/usr/src/app/processed`, `/usr/src/app/db`, and `/usr/src/app/failed`
